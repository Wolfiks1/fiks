Third-party python modules
--------------------------

TrueNAS uses system-wide python environment and relies on Debian repository to install python packages. However, some
of the required python packages are absent there, and others are outdated.

TrueNAS builder uses `python-truenas-requirements <https://github.com/truenas/python-truenas-requirements>`_ script to
generate `deb` packages from `requirements.txt`. Each python package gets one corresponding `deb` package with the
correct name, version and dependencies set; such packages integrate into TrueNAS Debian installation perfectly.

Adding a new third-party python module or upgrading an existing python module
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Add python module in question and all its dependencies into `requirements.txt`. Try to add as few as
   possible; if one of the module's dependencies is shipped with Debian, its better to install it using apt.
#. Run `generate.py` using the exact same Python version as TrueNAS. The easiest way to do this is using Docker:

    .. code-block:: shell

        docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/work -w /work debian:bookworm sh -c 'apt-get update && apt-get install -y git libffi-dev python3-virtualenv && python3 generate.py

#. Ensure that the resulting diff is a small as possible. Use `constraints.txt` to pin down some indirect dependencies
   to the versions shipped with Debian.
